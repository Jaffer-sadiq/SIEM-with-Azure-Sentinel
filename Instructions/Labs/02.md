# Lab 2: Conducting Log Analytics and Threat Hunting

### Estimated Duration: 30 minutes

In this lab, you will define a hypothesis for your threat hunting activities and create a structured hunt in Microsoft Sentinel. You will add queries to filter and analyze data, use bookmarks to save significant findings, and interact with key entities like users and IP addresses. Additionally, you will learn how to create incidents from aggregated alerts and track metrics to measure the effectiveness of your threat hunting efforts. This hands-on experience will enhance your skills in using Microsoft Sentinel for comprehensive threat detection and investigation.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

* Task 1: Define your hypothesis
* Task 2: Create a Hunt
* Task 3: Add a query to the hunt
* Task 4: Add and view the bookmark
* Task 5: Interact with entities
* Task 6: Create incidents
* Task 7: Track metrics

## Task 1: Define your hypothesis

Defining a hypothesis is an open-ended, flexible process that can include any idea you want to validate. Common hypotheses include:
- **Suspicious behavior**: Investigate potentially malicious activity that's visible in your environment to determine if an attack is occurring.
- **New threat campaign**: Look for types of malicious activity based on newly discovered threat actors, techniques, or vulnerabilities. This might be something you've heard about in a security news article.
- **Detection gaps**: Increase your detection coverage using the MITRE ATT&CK map to identify gaps.

Microsoft Sentinel gives you flexibility as you zero in on the right set of hunting queries to investigate your hypothesis.

### Task 1.1: Hypothesis - Suspicious behavior

1. In the search bar of the Azure portal, type **Sentinel (1)**, then select **Microsoft Sentinel (2)**.

   ![search sentinel](../media/search_sentinel.png)

2. Select the Microsoft Sentinel Workspace you created earlier. 

   ![select the sentinel workspace](../media/sentinel-workspace.png)

3. Select **Hunting (1)** under the **Threat management** section within the left navigation pane of the Microsoft Sentinel page, and then click on the **Queries (2)** tab.

   ![search sentinel](../media/hunting_page-queries_tab.png)

4. Click on **Run all queries** and wait for the queries to execute. This process may take a couple of minutes.

   ![Run all queries](../media/run_all_queries.png)

   >**Note**: With a well-established base of queries installed, running all your queries is the recommended method for identifying potentially malicious behaviors.

5. Notice that the **Result count** post-query runs within the metrics bar of the **Microsoft Sentinel | Hunting** page. These results of the query runs appear for specific query logs that have been identified.

   ![query result count](../media/result-count.png)

6. Click on the **Add filter (1)** button, and then select **Results (2)** from the list of options that appear.

   ![filter](../media/filter-results.png)

7. Within the **Results** pop-up dialog box,

   - Select the checkboxes with values greater than or equal to one **(1)**.
   - Click on **Apply (2)**.

     ![apply filter](../media/apply-filter.png)

      >**Note**: In this way, you can filter out the queries with at least one result for better visibility.
      
### Task 1.2: Hypothesis - New threat campaign

The content hub offers threat campaigns and domain-based solutions to hunt for specific attacks, such as the **Log4J Vulnerability Detection** content.

1. On the Microsoft Sentinel page, follow the below instructions to install the data connector:
